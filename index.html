        <h1>HOW MY WEEKEND WENT</h1>
        <h3>On Saturday</h3>
              
        I started the freecodecamp bootcamp during the week. On Monday,my lecturer gave us a project to complete by the end of the week
       <br>I had a tough time when I started because it was my first encounter with html </br>
            I started this assignment in the evening which was monday, around 6pm and i found it very interesting but i met some few challanges and i 
             consulted some freinds to help me and it was successful 
          <h3>On Sunday</h3> 
<br>They came to my appartment and we went through the project together and completed it. We then hosted the created website on github and finally submitted the fnished project</br>
